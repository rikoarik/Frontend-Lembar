## Change rule

An FR is `Implemented` only when:

- required decisions accepted;
- both surface and backend contract landed where applicable;
- evidence listed above exists;
- security/privacy/accessibility/analytics acceptance passes;
- task handoff accepted by owner;
- release gate status updated.
